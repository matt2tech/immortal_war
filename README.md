I planned on keeping this program to myself but eventually came around. Still a work in progress

Pip install pillow, prompt-toolkit
Will break if you don't
This is just the prologue and the first dungeon, so don't expect much.  If you want mob images turned on, go and remove all #'s from mob_images functions

Enjoy the game and send feedback
