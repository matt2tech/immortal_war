# immortal_war
I planned on keeping this program to myself but eventually came around. Still a work in progress

Pip install pillow, prompt-toolkit
Will break if you don't
This is just the prologue and the first dungeon, so don't expect much.  If you want mob images turned on, go and remove all #'s from mob_images functions
My future goals are to change over to tkinter and finishing the prologue.
Battles are explained in the game, but I'll explain saving here. To save, go back home and sleep in the bed.

Enjoy the game and send feedback
